                Now I position myself as a Middle JavaScript developer, for all the time of my development I gained a lot of experience, emphasized some features for myself, tried to write many projects (fortunately, most of them never saw the light of the day), worked with many libraries and I strive to develop further, gain more experience, work on interesting and complex projects, learn new programming languages and much more
